# LJ Code 201 - Day 1#
<br>
 Happy to have learned about the culture of CodeFellows. Was glad to meet some new people and am looking forward to group projects and building out something. The first project (user prompts) already got some of my creativity flowing and I'm looking forward to building on this knowledge, So many ideas just floating around. Can't wait to start learning about capturing user data and building interactivity into websites.

 The Client Side Server Side diagram really helped with understanding the internet. Separation of concerns seems pretty important.
 I think I will have some issues with style as some bad habits are already engrained
 Gotta keep memorizing the unix/bash commands.
 Stay away from Sudo and chmod
