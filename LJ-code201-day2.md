# LJ Code 201 - Day 2#
Today was fun but challenging. I learned quite a bit and worked together with Pavel over in the kitchen to complete our About Me projects eventually finding out I had done quite a few parts wrong. Guess that's what I get for separating from the class. Thankfully Maelle, Frazier and Sam were there to put me back on the right track. The quiz was good, challenging. I got confused at a few of the "identify the wrong code" parts because I like to assume nothing happened before that code. Made it through with flying colors though, thanks to a good amount of help from the staff.

Wishing we could move faster, but I know that if I jump in without understanding I'll end up where I usually end up when that happens, flailing. Definitely going to be a constant struggle even as I progress past the program. CSS was my downfall and I'm constantly reminded of that Peter Griffin CSS Window Shade gif as I work with it. Really want to focus on getting my CSS skills up to the point where they flow well with HTML and JS. Excited to continue onward.
