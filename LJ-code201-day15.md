#Learning Journal Day 15 10/11/2016#

Everything is going well. Working on group projects. Got a lot built yesterday. Learning about working with groups and some new JS techniques. Worked on HTML and CSS first half of yesterday then teamed up with Avery on the JS for the latter half. Worked on some Local Storage functionality last night at home. Got it all working together. Now just have to merge this morning once everyone arrives. I think this will be a great project.
