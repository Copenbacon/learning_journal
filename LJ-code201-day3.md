#Day 3#
Ran into some tough problems today with the alert on Question 7. Definitely need to git more. Add Commit Push. Add Commit Push. Would've been helpful in figuring out how I solved the problem. Seems like it magically worked after trying to show it to Sam. Other than that, everything went well. If I thought yesterday was slow, today was pretty damn fast. Just jumped right in there. Then I look at my page and feel like I've accomplished nothing. That's CSS for you though. Still need to work on CSS skills. Pretty rough stuff, but I'm excited to make things prettier.

Torn apart during the code review this morning. Gotta work harder on styling. Got those annoying rules loaded into atom, so that'll help a bit.

Excited to continue forward, loving the challenge this stuff is giving me.
