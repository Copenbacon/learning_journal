#Day 6 Sept 26 2016#
Learned a lot today. DOM tree, Domain Modeling, writing to an HTML page via JS. Pretty cool stuff. Very complex, gonna take a while to memorize all of this stuff in order to code more freely. All in all a good day. Still need to pretty up the page for Lab, but got all the functionality working. Happy with the results of the program so far.

Looking forward to expanding this knowledge and put it to use, though this Domain Modeling is already gonna be useful for the guy I'm currently working with.
