#Day 11 10/4/2016#

Today was a lot better than yesterday. I spent a lot of time yesterday trying to solve the img array comparison problems. Glad I got some help from Frazier as the entire app was killing me. He helped me a lot with event listeners as well. event.target and event.currentTarget are your friends. The charts.js and canvas stuff are like finding another great hall of books in a library... so much stuff. Such a dense amount of material there. Sam threw an Array question at me today that's still bugging me. Gotta wrap my head around that stuff and writing algorithms in my head, thinking about speaking and how to approach difficult questions like that. Met Colin today, former BizDev/Sales guy there. #opportunity Seems like a nice dude, glad to know sales/marketing is not that different across fields.
