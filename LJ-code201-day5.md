#Day 5 Learning Journal 9/25/2016 #

Well, I went home on Friday afternoon thinking I was pretty damned smart and doing great in this class. Then I read the chapters on DOM and Object Modelling and realized I still don't know shit about shit. This is going to be an interesting week and I'm definitely going to have to up my game to keep my head above water. I'm excited to get started on these concepts as the Object Models seem like pretty cool ways to build out business models and determine best, medium, and worst case scenarios for the future.

Finished up my about me page for now, gonna continue working on it and seeking to make it better and better as time goes on. Want to make it very slick and professional.

Still trying to work on my CSS game, though HTML and JavaScript are getting progressively better and I'm still enjoying JS a bit more. It's just a bit more rewarding to me to see a process work than to move a box to perfect center or to share equal amounts of space with a matching box, though it took me 5 times as long to move the box as it did to write the code to build the function. CSS is just not very rewarding. WHen I finish a problem in CSS I feel like saying "Thanks for doing your job, dipshit."
