Learned a lot today. Glad to be using object constructors. I can even see how building out literal objects from the start and then re-writing code to fit them into constructors would be helpful if say you were brainstorming through code and then figured out what your common elements were after the fact. Though whiteboarding and brainstorming would probably help alleviate this problem as well. Like they say, don't waste the energy when you've got it, you can always re-write it.

Really glad I'm taking this class, learning so much so fast. Definitely gonna need to keep coding on the weekends just to keep in practice. Like learning a new language.

Looking forward to this networking event tonight as well.
