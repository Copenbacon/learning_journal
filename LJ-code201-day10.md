#DAY 10 10/2/16#

Feeling good about this week. Had a great week last week. Really enjoying js, really enjoyed the WireFrame lab as I have been itching to work on CSS and Layout. Could definitely do with a few more of those exercises. Good weekend, got a lot done. Trying to focus on deciding between JS and Python for 401. Working with Apple sounds like a nightmare or owning a Mercedes.

Anyways, need to focus more on CSS and HTML. The drawing before building was very helpful, I just kinda wish you could build a template in photoshop, illustrator, paint, whatever, and translate it to HTML/CSS. Even if it was just a wireframe. That might be a sweet project to build out someday. Illustrator/photoshop already have objects, I think something like specifying object types would be helpful with a project like that. right click, select type, specify as h1, header, body, div, list, etc. Basically just connecting the two together or having a wireframe printout.

Looking forward to learning more JS this week, and developing the group projects.
